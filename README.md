# 🐶 Mini Project: Virtual Pet Simulator

A fun Python-based mini project by **Jabez Jesudason Jena** that uses object-oriented programming to simulate a virtual pet's hunger system. You can check, reduce, and display the hunger level of your pet.

## 🧠 How It Works

- Create a pet with a name and initial hunger level.
- Check whether the pet is hungry or not.
- Reduce hunger by "feeding" the pet.
- Display current hunger level.

## 🐾 Features

- Class-based structure (`Pet`)
- Simulates hunger system with logic
- Prevents invalid hunger reduction
- Interactive outputs for realism

## 📌 Sample Output

Dog hunger lvl is 20
Dog is hungry
Dog hunger lvl is reduced to 17
Dog hunger lvl is 17
Dog is hungry
Dog hunger lvl is reduced to 15
Dog hunger lvl is 15
Dog is hungry

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Running the Program

Save the script as `pet_simulator.py` and run:

```bash
python pet_simulator.py
```
🛠️ Ideas for Future Enhancements
Add mood, energy, or happiness levels

Create multiple pets

Add feeding log or timer-based hunger increase

Add GUI with Tkinter or web version with Flask
